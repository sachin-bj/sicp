(define (sqrt-iter guess x)
  (new-if (good-enough? guess x)
          guess
          (sqrt-iter (improve guess x)
x)))

=>  good-enough? returns true or false, guess is already a number and hence in the simplest form it doesn't get evaluated any further. The infinite recursion occurs at sqrt-iter call because it will get evaluated no matter what good-enough?.
